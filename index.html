<H3>Eco-Social Homeland Network</H3>

<p><b>We are beings of Earth, Denizens of our <em>home planet</em>.</b></b> Our home planet is a collective organism comprised of groups and individuals dedicated to creating society partnered with our homelands' naturally occurring ecosystems in harmonious, attentive, relationships.  

<p>So as to grow from the zero-point energy that is awareness of the present moment (more nourishing than sunshine) and from awareness of the 'gods' of our imediate reality (Forces acting upon 'us' that cannot be controlled but only jovialy mated with, through being willing and thus passionately willful, to transcend along the spiral of Life through Time.), we identify Ourself with our atmospheric dynamics and our plant life and our vital earthen soil, and our thousand qualities of snow, and our bio-regions and our microlimates, our bodies' electromagnetic common soul, and our united global light-ware flow.  

<p>With our whole heart we vow to become more than identical with all the things that shape us.  We are forever committing to disolve our lables for things that my be much subtler, much deeper warm, much more vital and vibrant and sweet, than we can suppose.  To become infinitely receptive to the beings we may consider "other" than our "selves" so may we fall into Life as the Love in Ourself.
